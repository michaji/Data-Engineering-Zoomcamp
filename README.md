## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my journey through the **[DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)**. As an **AI/ML Engineer** with a focus on **production-grade systems, model optimization, and scalable pipelines**, I’m exploring data engineering to bridge the gap between AI/ML and robust data infrastructure.

Here, you’ll find my solutions, experiments, and notes for each week of the Zoomcamp, along with custom projects that integrate data engineering tools with AI/ML workflows (e.g., RAG pipelines, scalable data processing, and deployment).

---

## 🚀 Why This Repository?
- **Showcase Skills:** Demonstrate my ability to design, build, and deploy scalable data pipelines and infrastructure.
- **Bridge AI/ML and Data Engineering:** Explore how data engineering principles can enhance AI/ML systems—from data ingestion to model deployment.
- **Learn in Public:** Share my progress, challenges, and insights with the community. Feedback, collaborations, and suggestions are welcome!
